Stevens Log In: cruan2@stevens.edu

GitHub URL: https://github.com/lostinlawrence/CS515Project.git

Total Hours Spent: About 10 Hours

How I Tested My Code: I used all the inputs posted on Adventure description on Canvas and make sure the all the outputs match.

Bug or Issues: 
1 The most challenging part of the project is how to organize all these methods and classes. The project can be organized in many ways.

2 When implementing the help verb, I did not knwo how to do it other than plaintext.

Revolsed Bug or Issues: To do help verb, I used a dictionary to store all the functiions. When adding a new function or verb, it has to be added to the dictionary. The help function will print all the keys of the function, this will make sure the help verb is consistent with all the functions.

Extensions Implemented:
1 drop verb
2 Directions become verb, my directions only contains east, west, south and north.
3 help verb
